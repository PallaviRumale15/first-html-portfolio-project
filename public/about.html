<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated software developer with over 9.5 years of professional experience building reliable and scalable solutions. My career has spanned diverse projects, from Windows application development to designing and implementing REST APIs, and I am currently expanding my expertise into modern web technologies with React and JavaScript. With a strong foundation in backend and system-level development, I bring both technical depth and adaptability to every project I take on.</p>

<p>What drives me is the challenge of solving complex problems and transforming ideas into practical, high-quality applications. I thrive in environments where innovation meets precision, and I enjoy collaborating with teams to deliver solutions that make a meaningful impact.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I am passionate about exploring the world through travel, experimenting with flavors in the kitchen, and expressing creativity through dance. These hobbies keep me inspired, balanced, and open to new perspectives—qualities I bring back into my professional work as well.</p>
